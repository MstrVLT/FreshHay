Fresh Hay is a homebrew app designed to be part of Kefir.

It downloads firmware version supported by provided Atmosphere/SX OS versions to be installed via ChoiDujourNX.

Fresh Hay relies on config file located at `/switch/FreshHay/target.json`

## TODO

Current version is good enough for its purpose, it is tested and was used to update firmware on my device.

I'm planning to continue upgrading it.

Current plans:
- check that SD card has enough free space;
- print remaining waiting time if Mega.nz limit is reached;
- suggest removing archive and corresponding firmware folder if already installed;
- download firmware list and allow choosing specific version.

Probably later:
- replace console with GUI;

## Special Thanks
